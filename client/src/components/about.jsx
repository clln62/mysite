                Before a career as an Engineer, Collin has had an eclectic life from debuting his 
                plays in Times Square and shooting films in Central Park, leading a marketing 
                campaign for a fashion designer to deploying to Iraq as an Infantryman in the 
                US Army. Quick thinking and problem-solving have always been a part of Collin's 
                life, and he looks forward to continuing that in the world of tech.
