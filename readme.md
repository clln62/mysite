# Welcome to Collin's Page!

This project is an opportunity for me to continue my passion in building apps, but also a great way to build a way for others to access my work in one simple location. This is an ongoing, side project that gives me the chance to continue my learning when not working on other applications and studies.

### Front-End

For simple use and clean code, I separated my app components through React. In the future, I will also be using Axios to pass user information to my server when someone uses the contact form on the app.

### Back-End

NodeJS and Express are being partnered together to power the back end to power a simple site in a simple and clean way.

### Deployment

In the future, I look to use AWS EC2 using PM2 for running the server and route the traffic through NGINX.

### APIs

At this time there is no need for an API, but the continued education may be fun. TBD.



## Challenges & Learning

This project has been a fun way for me to work creatively without limitations and try things that I haven't done before. 

### Challenges

- Without restrictions, I find that at times I like to explore a lot of creative options that can take me on a deep rabbit hole.<br/>
- As of right now, there are no set timeline goals, so this tends to take a back seat to other projects.<br/>

### Learnings

- Not holding back on different ideas and technologies has allowed me to grow my new skill base, but also build on my current knowledge.<br/>
